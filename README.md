# Swappy

Swappy is a command-line tool for quickly swapping windows
between monitors or regions.
I wrote this because I was frustrated with my multi-monitor experience:
glancing at side monitors is fine,
but sometimes my quick reference glance turns into a deep dive,
and my neck starts to complain.
At the same time, I'm not super interested in tiling window managers
and was looking to improve my floating WM experience.

Swappy currently only supports Windows 10.
